## Changes against the FLT file

- Imports of FLT modules (`Definitions.*`, `Theorems.*`, `P2M.*`) are renamed to `Langlands.AnthropicFLT.*`; Mathlib imports are unchanged.
- The FLT lakefile options are inserted after the imports: `maxHeartbeats 4000000`, `synthInstance.maxHeartbeats 400000`, `backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency.types false`.
- An attribution header comment is added at the top of the file.
- The import of the FLT utility module `P2M.Util` (custom tactics and commands) is dropped.
- The FLT proof `by p2m_exact_reverting @_root_.P2MW.S_AlgebraicGeometry_surj_inj_isSeparated_pieces_sigmaDesc_of_forall_represents_hilbertPolynomial_eq_of_nat_of_eq_comp_sigmaInj.solution` (a tactic from `P2M.Util`) is replaced by the term `P2MW.S_AlgebraicGeometry_surj_inj_isSeparated_pieces_sigmaDesc_of_forall_represents_hilbertPolynomial_eq_of_nat_of_eq_comp_sigmaInj.solution S f 𝓛X hX₁ hX₂ C πC ptC hnatC hsurjC hinjC hproperC hlfpC pt hnat hconst`, the solution theorem applied to the explicit arguments of the theorem. The theorem statement is unchanged by this edit.
- Universe generalization. The FLT development works in universe 0 (`Type`, `Scheme.{0}`). For this project the ported files of the Hom-scheme construction are generalized to an arbitrary universe `uz`, so that the construction applies to abelian schemes over rings in any universe. Mechanical part in this file: a line `universe uz` is added (line 21 here); in 29 lines the replacements `Type` (universe 0) → `Type uz` (17 places), `Scheme.{0}` → `Scheme.{uz}` (13 places) are made, and these lines are otherwise unchanged. Consequently the theorem statement becomes universe-polymorphic; the further changes are listed in the next item.
- Further changes (universe generalization and pieces strengthening): Statement change (strengthening the Hilbert-polynomial pieces clause): the FLT clause `∀ Pℚ, ∃ U : Opens, IsClosed U ∧ QuasiCompact (U.ι ≫ π) ∧ (∀ families, range ⊆ U ↔ Hilbert polynomial Pℚ)` is replaced by `∃ U : Polynomial ℚ → Opens, Pairwise (Function.onFun Disjoint U) ∧ (⨆ Pℚ, U Pℚ) = ⊤ ∧ ∀ Pℚ, IsClosed (U Pℚ) ∧ QuasiCompact ((U Pℚ).ι ≫ π) ∧ (…)`: the pieces form one family of pairwise disjoint opens covering the scheme. This is needed by the task (the relative endomorphism scheme is the disjoint union of its pieces) and implies the FLT clause. The pieces are the ones of the FLT proof (images of the coproduct inclusions, and their preimages in the later stages). The changed lines are:

## Content

Statement. `AlgebraicGeometry.surj_inj_isSeparated_pieces_sigmaDesc_of_forall_represents_hilbertPolynomial_eq_of_nat_of_eq_comp_sigmaInj`:
in the setting of `exists_pt_sigma_nat_and_eq_comp_sigmaInj_of_forall_represents_hilbertPolynomial_eq`, assume each
`C P` represents (surjectively, and injectively up to isomorphism) the families with Hilbert polynomial `P`, is
proper and locally of finite presentation, and that `pt` into `∐ C` is natural and restricts to `ptC P ≫ ι_P` on
families with Hilbert polynomial `P`. Then `pt` is surjective and injective up to isomorphism, `∐ C ⟶ Spec S` is
separated and locally of finite presentation, and there is a family `U P` of pairwise disjoint opens covering
`∐ C`, each closed and quasi-compact over `Spec S`, such that a family lands in `U P` iff its Hilbert polynomial is
`P`.

The proof term applies the companion solution theorem `P2MW.S_AlgebraicGeometry_surj_inj_isSeparated_pieces_sigmaDesc_of_forall_represents_hilbertPolynomial_eq_of_nat_of_eq_comp_sigmaInj.solution`.
