Ported for task `6d6cc279-3071-445f-adba-589e54d9816b` (projective representability of the relative endomorphism functor of a projective abelian scheme). Proof module (FLT `P2M/Sol/`).

Port of `P2M/Sol/S_AlgebraicGeometry_HilbertFunctor_mem_of_forall_exists_X_pow_mul_mem_of_forall_mem_iff_app_awayToSection_eq_zero.lean` from the Anthropic Lean formalisation of Fermat's Last Theorem (commit `6e837e75355538c7f80bab5b956861e86c4eacc2`; project literature folder "Anthropic - Fermat's Last Theorem - complete Lean source at 6e837e75355538c7f80bab5b956861e86c4eacc2", literature id `anthropic-flt-complete-lean-source-6e837e75`).

## Changes against the FLT file

- Imports of FLT modules (`Definitions.*`, `Theorems.*`, `P2M.*`) are renamed to `Langlands.AnthropicFLT.*`; Mathlib imports are unchanged.
- The FLT lakefile options are inserted after the imports: `maxHeartbeats 4000000`, `synthInstance.maxHeartbeats 400000`, `backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency.types false`.
- An attribution header comment is added at the top of the file.
- The import of the FLT utility module `P2M.Util` (custom tactics and commands) is dropped.
- Universe generalization. The FLT development works in universe 0 (`Type`, `Scheme.{0}`). For this project the ported files of the Hom-scheme construction are generalized to an arbitrary universe `uz`, so that the construction applies to abelian schemes over rings in any universe. Mechanical part in this file: a line `universe uz` is added (line 17 here); in 2 lines the replacements `Type` (universe 0) → `Type uz` (1 place), `Scheme.{0}` → `Scheme.{uz}` (1 place) are made, and these lines are otherwise unchanged. Consequently the statements become universe-polymorphic; for `uz = 0` (and universe 0 for `Type*` binders) they are the FLT ones.
- No other change: apart from the edits listed above, the declarations, statements and proofs are the FLT text.

## Content

The theorem `P2MW.S_AlgebraicGeometry_HilbertFunctor_mem_of_forall_exists_X_pow_mul_mem_of_forall_mem_iff_app_awayToSection_eq_zero.solution` proves the statement of the companion theorem in `Langlands.AnthropicFLT.Theorems.Thm_AlgebraicGeometry_HilbertFunctor_mem_of_forall_exists_X_pow_mul_mem_of_forall_mem_iff_app_awayToSection_eq_zero`. Statement. `AlgebraicGeometry.HilbertFunctor.mem_of_forall_exists_X_pow_mul_mem_of_forall_mem_iff_app_awayToSection_eq_zero`:
let `I` be an ideal of `k[X₀, …, Xₙ]` (a field `k`) whose forms of each degree are exactly those
vanishing on a closed subscheme `Z_k` in all charts. Then `I` is saturated: a form `F` with
`Xᵢ^N F ∈ I` for every `i` (some `N`) lies in `I`.

Proof. For each `i`, `Xᵢ^N F ∈ I` vanishes on the chart `D₊(Xᵢ)`, and its dehomogenization
`Xᵢ^N F / Xᵢ^{N + d}` equals `F / Xᵢ^d` in the degree-zero localization (`HomogeneousLocalization.val_injective`
and a direct computation). So `F` vanishes on every chart, hence `F ∈ I`.

## Declarations

Names and namespaces are the FLT ones; statements are the FLT ones up to the changes listed above. Solution modules put their auxiliary declarations in the FLT namespace `P2MW.<module name>`.
