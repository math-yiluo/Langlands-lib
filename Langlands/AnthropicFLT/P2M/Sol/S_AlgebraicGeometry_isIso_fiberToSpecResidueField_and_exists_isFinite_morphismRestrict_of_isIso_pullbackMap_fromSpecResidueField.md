Ported for task `6d6cc279-3071-445f-adba-589e54d9816b` (projective representability of the relative endomorphism functor of a projective abelian scheme). Proof module (FLT `P2M/Sol/`).

## Source and licence

Port of `P2M/Sol/S_AlgebraicGeometry_isIso_fiberToSpecResidueField_and_exists_isFinite_morphismRestrict_of_isIso_pullbackMap_fromSpecResidueField.lean` from the Anthropic Lean formalisation of Fermat's Last Theorem (commit `6e837e75355538c7f80bab5b956861e86c4eacc2`; project literature folder "Anthropic - Fermat's Last Theorem - complete Lean source at 6e837e75355538c7f80bab5b956861e86c4eacc2", literature id `anthropic-flt-complete-lean-source-6e837e75`).

## Changes against the FLT file

- Imports of FLT modules (`Definitions.*`, `Theorems.*`, `P2M.*`) are renamed to `Langlands.AnthropicFLT.*`; Mathlib imports are unchanged.
- The FLT lakefile options are inserted after the imports: `maxHeartbeats 4000000`, `synthInstance.maxHeartbeats 400000`, `backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency.types false`.
- An attribution header comment is added at the top of the file.
- The import of the FLT utility module `P2M.Util` (custom tactics and commands) is dropped.
- Universe generalization. The FLT development works in universe 0 (`Type`, `Scheme.{0}`). For this project the ported files of the Hom-scheme construction are generalized to an arbitrary universe `uz`, so that the construction applies to abelian schemes over rings in any universe. Mechanical part in this file: a line `universe uz` is added (line 14 here); in 2 lines the replacements `Scheme.{0}` → `Scheme.{uz}` (2 places) are made, and these lines are otherwise unchanged. Consequently the statements become universe-polymorphic; for `uz = 0` (and universe 0 for `Type*` binders) they are the FLT ones.
- No other change: apart from the edits listed above, the declarations, statements and proofs are the FLT text.

## Content

The theorem `P2MW.S_AlgebraicGeometry_isIso_fiberToSpecResidueField_and_exists_isFinite_morphismRestrict_of_isIso_pullbackMap_fromSpecResidueField.solution` proves the statement of the companion theorem in `Langlands.AnthropicFLT.Theorems.Thm_AlgebraicGeometry_isIso_fiberToSpecResidueField_and_exists_isFinite_morphismRestrict_of_isIso_pullbackMap_fromSpecResidueField`. Statement. `AlgebraicGeometry.isIso_fiberToSpecResidueField_and_exists_isFinite_morphismRestrict_of_isIso_pullbackMap_fromSpecResidueField`:
for proper, flat, finitely presented `p`, `q` and `h : Z ⟶ X` over `Y`, if the map of fibres `h_y` is an
isomorphism then for every `x` over `y` the fibre of `h` over `x` maps isomorphically to `Spec κ(x)`, and `h` is
finite over some open neighbourhood of `y`.

Proof. The fibre of `h` over `x` is the fibre over `x` of the isomorphism `h_y`, hence isomorphic to `Spec κ(x)`
(local `isIso_fiberToSpecResidueField`). So `h` is quasi-finite at all points over `y`; `h` is proper, and the
quasi-finite locus of a proper morphism is open, so its complement has closed image under `q` avoiding `y`. Over
the complementary neighbourhood `h` is proper and quasi-finite, hence finite.

## Declarations

Names and namespaces are the FLT ones; statements are the FLT ones up to the changes listed above. Solution modules put their auxiliary declarations in the FLT namespace `P2MW.<module name>`.
