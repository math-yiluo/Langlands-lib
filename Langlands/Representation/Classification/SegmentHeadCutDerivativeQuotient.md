# Actual quotient maps for consecutive cuts of special-head derivatives

Author: Worker 357.

This internal construction assembles published individual-head embeddings,
general derivative quotients, rank transports and elementary tensor contractions.
It introduces no assertion transcribed from original literature.

## Interface and conventions

The declaration is
`Langlands.Classification.SegmentHeadCut.headCutDerivativeQuotient`
under `Langlands.Classification.SegmentHeadCut`. Fix arbitrary
`{p : ℕ} [Fact p.Prime]`, an actual `F : PadicField.{uF} p`, supplied
`T : F.TopologicalData`, and a bundled continuous nontrivial unitary additive
character `ψ` for `T.topology`. Every smooth category uses that supplied topology.

Let `ρ : CuspidalDatum.{uV,uF} T`, write `r = ρ.rank`, and supply positive
integers `a,b` with proofs `ha,hb`. Supply the following actual smooth complex
representations and special-head relations:

| Object | Group rank | Relation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `π` | `(a+b)*r` | `T.IsSegmentHead ⟨ρ,a+b,by omega⟩ π` |
| `π₁` | `a*r` | `T.IsSegmentHead ⟨ρ.twist (b : ℝ),a,ha⟩ π₁` |
| `π₂` | `b*r` | `T.IsSegmentHead ⟨ρ,b,hb⟩ π₂` |

The caller also supplies an actual
`A : SupercuspidalRep.{uF,uV} (F := F.Carrier) (n := r)` and
`hA : ρ.IsRepresentedBy A`. The returned data has type

```text
{q : ((generalLinearDerivative T ψ ((a+b)*r) (b*r) hd ⋙
         generalLinearRankCast T hk).obj π) ⟶ π₁ //
  Function.Surjective (SmoothRep.hom q)}
```

Here `hd` is the proof `b*r ≤ (a+b)*r` obtained by distributing
`(a+b)*r`, and `hk` is the equality
`(a+b)*r - b*r = a*r` obtained by the same distribution and natural-number
subtraction. These are the literal proof arguments in the Lean interface.
Thus the source is the ordinary derivative of order `b*r`, followed by
transport of its output group rank to `a*r`. The target is the supplied
upper, shifted shorter head. The lower shorter head is a supplied object used
to construct the map.

The original carrier universe `uV` is independent of `uF`. The representative
`A` has carrier in `Type uV`; the three heads, the derivatives, the tensors and
the inductions used here have carriers in `Type (max uF uV)`. The general
derivative/tensor constructions are instantiated at that maximum universe.
There is no universe resizing or finite-dimensionality hypothesis.

The result contains an actual equivariant complex-linear map, with its actual
function-surjectivity proof retained as data. It is a chosen quotient map:
no preferred choice, naturality or compatibility among different cuts is
asserted. No comparison map, contraction, nonvanishing hypothesis or
irreducibility of an intermediate derivative is required from the caller.
`IsSegmentHead` retains the published strong-head relation for increasing
segment induction; it is not replaced by the socle of increasing induction.

## Implemented construction

First form the published positive-rank comparison

```text
e : (T.binaryNormalizedProductFunctor (a*r) (b*r)).obj (π₁,π₂) ≅
      T.normalizedParabolicInduced
        (Shahidi.twoBlocks (a*r) (b*r) hpos₁ hpos₂)
        (binaryLeviTensor T hpos₁ hpos₂ π₁ π₂).representation.
```

In this display the induced smooth object is understood. Both positivity
proofs follow from `ha,hb` and `ρ.rank_pos`. The comparison is
`T.binaryNormalizedProductTwoBlockIso`: equality of the two actual block shapes
and their ordered dependent factor families gives equality transport of
normalized induction. The first block is `π₁`, the second is `π₂`. The
normalization, upper parabolic and right-translation action are unchanged.

Put `D₂ = (generalLinearDerivative T ψ (b*r) (b*r) le_rfl).obj π₂`.
The published `segmentHeadTopDerivativeNontrivial` applied to `hπ₂` makes
`D₂` nontrivial. The private `rankCast_nontrivial'` transfers this to
`(topDerivative T ψ (b*r)).obj π₂`, whose rank-zero output is an equality
transport of `D₂`. The published `BinaryTensor.firstFactorQuotient` now supplies
a surjective intertwiner from `π₁` tensored with this full vector space to
`π₁`. Converting it with `SmoothRep.ofHom` gives

```text
c : (firstFactorTopDerivative T ψ (a*r) (b*r)).obj (π₁,π₂) ⟶ π₁.
```

This functor's group acts on the first tensor factor only, so the literal
source representation is precisely the published one-factor tensor action.
The contraction chooses a nonzero vector in the second factor and a complex
linear functional taking value one there. On pure tensors it sends
`v ⊗ w` to `φ(w) • v`. No scalar-line identification of the top derivative
is used.

Let `h = Nat.add_mul a b r` and
`X = (generalLinearRankCast T h).obj π`.
The published `headCutEmbedding` injects `π` into the rank-transported binary
product of `π₁,π₂`. The private `uncastEmbedding` eliminates the equality `h`
to view this as an injection of `X` into the binary product itself.
Composing its smooth morphism with `e.hom` gives an actual injective
intertwiner `j` into the displayed normalized parabolic induction.
Irreducibility from `hπ` makes `π` a nontrivial simple group-algebra module;
rank transport retains nontriviality for `X`. An injective map with such a
source cannot be zero: a nonzero vector and injectivity contradict the
zero-map assumption.

Apply the published `binaryTensorDerivativeQuotientOfInducedMap` to `j`.
The necessary irreducibility and admissibility of both factors are
`hπ₁.isIrreducible`, `hπ₂.isIrreducible`, `hπ₁.isAdmissible` and
`hπ₂.isAdmissible`. Its returned map `q.val` is surjective from the ordinary
order-`b*r` derivative of `X`, transported to rank `a*r`, onto
`firstFactorTopDerivative.obj (π₁,π₂)`.

The private `derivativeFixedOutputIso` constructs the isomorphism
`E` from the displayed derivative of `π` to that derivative of `X`.
It whiskers the published `generalLinearRankCastDerivativeIso` by the
common output rank cast. The equality
`generalLinearRankCast_trans` identifies the two composite output
transports. Taking the inverse component gives the required direction.
The helper works for any equal input ranks, derivative order and common
output rank; it is an equality-transport fact, not a derivative formula.

The final map is literally

```text
E.hom ≫ q.val ≫ c.
```

Surjectivity of the underlying linear map of `E.hom`, the witness attached
to `q`, and the contraction's witness compose to prove the returned property.
The three private helpers are grouped with this constructor as a focused unit.

## Published inputs and mathematical dependency audit

The audit uses Library `83a867912d2befca2ebf3e208f7d8fc29ae19ec5`.
All six direct imports are independently accepted, published modules.
All 1,132 inherited project Lean/Markdown pairs in the recursive closure
match this published tree byte for byte. This pair is the only new module.
The full inventory below contains 1,133 project modules and 300 distinct
external imports at the project boundary; the latter is a frontier count,
not a transitive Mathlib inventory.

The inherited module set is exactly the union of the earlier cut-embedding,
individual-head top-derivative, binary-tensor quotient, binary/two-block
comparison and one-factor quotient inventories. No additional inherited
module or external import is introduced by this assembly. Every inherited
Lean hash occurs unchanged in at least one of those inventories. The current
Markdown of `SegmentHeadTopDerivative`, `BinaryTensorInducedQuotient`,
`BinaryTwoBlockIso` and `OneFactorQuotient` was checked separately against
their current published explanations; their Lean bodies are unchanged.
The newer cut inventory already includes the general lower-file updates
since the earlier top-derivative inventory.

The used proof bodies have these roles:

- [SegmentHeadCutEmbedding](SegmentHeadCutEmbedding.md) constructs the actual
  long-head injection into the ordered shorter-head product. It uses the
  independent individual-head decreasing embeddings, actual consecutive
  regrouping, binary induction injectivity, general product nonvanishing,
  irreducible-factor finite length and extraction of the ambient strong socle
  into a nonzero Artinian subobject. Individual-head existence uses actual
  cuspidal Jacquet counts, exactness and subobject/quotient detection through
  a common-image multiplicity-one proof. It uses no full segment Jacquet
  formula or full product criterion.
- [SegmentHeadTopDerivative](SegmentHeadTopDerivative.md) obtains the only
  derivative nonvanishing used here. The decreasing induction of the supplied
  individual head has ordered supercuspidal twists. Restricting its injection
  gives a nonzero mirabolic submodule. The independently proved BZ77 4.11
  `orderedCuspidalProductNoDegenerateSubmodules` and the actual restriction
  bridge show nontriviality of the entire top derivative. This is the
  permitted individual-head top-order result. The imported module also
  contains a scalar-line construction using general Gelfand–Kazhdan
  multiplicity one; the new constructor uses only nontriviality.
- The BZ77 4.11 proof uses general derivative exactness, the general Leibniz
  filtration, mixed-product compatibility and detection, supercuspidal
  derivatives, Ze80 5.3 homogeneity and the general Ze80 3.7(b) comparison
  through BZ77 Lemma 4.7(b). The ordered twist condition excludes the
  forbidden support occurrence. Its lower proof and all nine generic
  infrastructure modules remain exactly the permitted published closure
  documented in the top-derivative and BZ77 proof Markdown.
- [BinaryTensorInducedQuotient](../Derivative/BinaryTensorInducedQuotient.md)
  proves the general quotient used on `j`. Scalar Schur and tensor density
  make the actual indexed binary Levi tensor irreducible. Nonzero Jacquet
  evaluation of the induced map is then onto. The proved general normalized
  derivative/Jacquet comparison, quotient-lift surjectivity and the actual
  binary tensor/partial-derivative comparison give its ordinary derivative
  source and entire top-derivative tensor target. Quotient universal
  properties and the actual normalized minus tower establish the latter
  comparison. No segment formula or top-derivative dimension premise enters.
- [RankCastCompat](../Derivative/RankCastCompat.md) and the rank-cast
  composition law are general equality transports. The new helpers use
  their actual isomorphisms and equality elimination only.
- [BinaryTwoBlockIso](../Induction/BinaryTwoBlockIso.md) identifies the same
  positive normalized induction on equal ordered two-block shapes. It imports
  no derivative or classification module.
- [OneFactorQuotient](../Tensor/OneFactorQuotient.md) is elementary tensor
  algebra. The tensor universal property proves equivariance of contraction;
  a vector and a functional pairing to one give explicit preimages. Algebraic
  dual separation over `ℂ` and classical choice give the chosen actual map.
  It imports no derivative or classification module.

The closure also contains general analytic predicates, essential/tempered
definitions and their statement modules through individual-head infrastructure.
No classification theorem is extracted from them. The used bodies and
published lower proof routes supplement a comment- and string-free recursive
code scan for host-excluded task identifiers, statement/theorem spellings,
proof holes, axioms and prohibited execution syntax. The scan has no hits;
there are no missing modules or paired Markdown files. This is an author
dependency audit, not independent semantic acceptance, and does not claim
that all inherited source files were newly read line by line.

## Operator rulings and retained boundaries

The six complete trusted operator files were read:

- [bd71b9185aab5d6eafffb7891bd3a3ca](/home/taskhub/pilot/correspondence/bd71b9185aab5d6eafffb7891bd3a3ca.md)
  permits fully proved general derivative theory while preserving independence.
- [0edda6122ce65ed7ac51603c37473920](/home/taskhub/pilot/correspondence/0edda6122ce65ed7ac51603c37473920.md)
  permits the published BZ77 4.11 result, the general Ze80 3.7(b)/Lemma 4.7(b)
  and 5.3 branches, and the nine generic modules. This assembly uses that
  permission through its published general and individual-head inputs.
- [30144f6f9b59540b88b6d4c1517892d9](/home/taskhub/pilot/correspondence/30144f6f9b59540b88b6d4c1517892d9.md)
  permits the exact independently proved support-only truncation bound as a
  host input. That bound is not imported or used by this constructor.
- [ed80148e21e7523abfc048f455e98eb0](/home/taskhub/pilot/correspondence/ed80148e21e7523abfc048f455e98eb0.md)
  confines `core_mid` and its simple-factor consequence to the support proof's
  length-two base. Neither enters this closure.
- [2b33898bdd0a5ff1b9031be5155a06f0](/home/taskhub/pilot/correspondence/2b33898bdd0a5ff1b9031be5155a06f0.md)
  and [ca18fd5005bf5e12a3f7cade18dca865](/home/taskhub/pilot/correspondence/ca18fd5005bf5e12a3f7cade18dca865.md)
  permit only the specified adjacent-supercuspidal reducibility input within
  that support proof. This assembly uses no such reducibility input.

The new result asserts an actual quotient onto a supplied shorter head.
It does not identify the whole derivative with that head, prove derivative
irreducibility, count its factors, or give a multiplicity or full derivative
formula. It establishes neither direction of the host product criterion.

The closure preserves independence, including renamed conclusions and
proof successors, from Ze80 3.5/9.6; the excluded segment/head/socle
derivative and full-Jacquet formulas; the segment-socle part of
`8e5b4563-0365-41c7-b134-70f2a0b36292`; and the host's excluded
segment-socle product, linked-structure, gluing, commutation and classification
conclusions. In particular it imports neither `SegmentHeadSupportStep`,
`SegmentHeadJacquetReduction`, `SegmentSocleJacquetReduction`,
`TwoSupercuspidalProductStructureProof`, nor `UniverseLiftPadic`.
The extra derivative-route exclusions
`ed48ae06-964c-4c84-9e62-978f5a953ca7`,
`b95105c6-f8bb-4641-ae53-2f49d1e7f034`,
`55ad1e10-62d8-46b7-a081-909ef0056426`,
`92aea10f-62ac-4e0b-bd4a-9a80909797c5` and
`2ae5cbe5-0701-4509-88a0-db8cbeb35be4` supply no excluded conclusion.

It uses neither `SegmentHeadProductIrreducibility` nor its parent
`GenericSegmentProductUniqueness` conclusion
(`30341ae4-65f2-4a0e-9283-763db01a409e`), multisegment exhaustion
(`3bfb61fa-1129-4fc9-83fd-7fcfec22106e`), ordered strong-head existence
(`ebea9a8a-9b21-4208-aa31-98c2dea1f8a3`), quotient coverage
(`20e4e1c6-0f4f-4ca7-96b9-a214ba1a7584`), ordered conversion
(`8252833d-c269-41a9-824c-5879e531b23b`), tempered uniqueness
(`52e97845-36bb-457d-b76f-70753334b88c`),
`SquareIntegrableLanglandsClassification`
(`1cb45da2-7007-4351-a694-594fb148b8d1`), square-integrable exhaustion
(`cd8ab97c-0b78-4bce-97c4-d307a28159a4`), or regular exhaustion
(`bf433f0a-921a-428c-b0c0-6475438125ac`). Published lower constructions from
this host do not assume its final criterion. No citation, proposition
definition, draft or pending candidate is treated as a proved input.
