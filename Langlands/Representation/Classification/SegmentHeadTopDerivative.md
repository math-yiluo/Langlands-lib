# The top derivative of a supplied special head

Author: Worker 357.

`Langlands.Classification.segmentHeadTopDerivativeLineEquiv` returns an
actual complex-linear equivalence from the entire top general-linear
derivative of any supplied special head to the complex scalars. The
parameters retain an arbitrary prime, the actual p-adic field, its supplied
topology, the bundled nontrivial continuous unitary additive character,
and independent field and original carrier universes. The supplied head
has the existing carrier universe `max uF uV`. The only representation
premise is the existing `T.IsSegmentHead Δ π` relation; no nonvanishing,
finite-length, scalar-model or segment derivative formula is assumed.

`segmentHeadTopDerivativeNontrivial` proves the nonvanishing first. Choose
an actual supercuspidal representative of the segment base from a copy
of the supplied head witness. The published `decreasingSocleEmbedding`
gives an actual injective intertwiner into decreasing induction. The
published `segmentDecreasingCuspidalProduct` supplies actual supercuspidal
factors, equality of their induced object with this induction and the
ordered condition `i < j → A_j ≠ ν A_i` on rank-indexed classes.

A private helper restricts the actual injection to the mirabolic subgroup;
its underlying linear map remains injective. The source is nontrivial by
irreducibility, so its range is a nonzero invariant subspace of the
restricted product. The independently published
`orderedCuspidalProductNoDegenerateSubmodules` gives nontriviality of the
actual top mirabolic derivative of that range. Mapping the actual
`LevelCalculus.isoRange` through this derivative functor transports
nontriviality to the restricted source. The proved restriction bridge
identifies the resulting object with its full general-linear top
derivative. Positivity of the segment degree permits the successor-rank
form of this argument, including degree one.

The supplied strong head relation already includes irreducibility. The
published head-finiteness interface derives admissibility. The private
positive-rank wrapper applies the general `topDerivativeLineEquiv` to
these two properties and the established nonvanishing. That construction
uses the proved general multiplicity-one input to obtain dimension one
and chooses a linear equivalence with the scalars. No naturality or
coherence of the resulting equivalence is claimed.

This is a derived internal composition of published interfaces. It
proves neither direction of the full `SegmentHeadProductIrreducibility`
criterion, any intermediate derivative/truncation formula, nor a
comparison between different ambient products. The private helper has
an explicit BZ proposition parameter; both public declarations discharge
it with the actual published proof. It is not an additional public
hypothesis.

The operator response
[0edda6122ce65ed7ac51603c37473920](/home/taskhub/pilot/correspondence/0edda6122ce65ed7ac51603c37473920.md)
to request `d910ee3b12f2515f9568a4f2f2f1442f` explicitly authorizes this
host to reuse BZ77 4.11 after independent acceptance and publication,
including the general Ze80 3.7(b) comparison through the Lemma 4.7(b)
closure, Ze80 5.3 `leftMixedProductHomogeneity` and the nine generic
modules authorized for the producer. All host Independence exclusions
remain. The following audit records both the import closure and the
mathematical dependencies of this composition.

## Published input verification

The audit base is Library
`6fd0709bd33fa6c33b4d74b4b638cfc51428b8f1`. Before mathematical reuse,
the ledger for the BZ proof
`bfc08f82-c488-4a15-8d7f-f92c86e12803` was fetched and checked:
`accepted = true`, `public = true`, independent approval by Reviewer 8153,
exact-target machine acceptance, and publication integration
`75ecdef35b4042a0ac9b0793139a7e26` at that Library commit. Its three
Lean/Markdown pairs are byte-identical in the frozen reviewed submission,
the published Library and this workspace. The root Lean SHA256 is
`67cdceb75f4565ebf5708193960e8aa8ff2b97df7ef694b1f9e317ae27200aa8`;
the root Markdown SHA256 is
`b20cff3bea0443b6d1002931494649629a24d9dfa92c434a283b6825f17330f6`.
The two other pairs are `OrderedCuspidalProductHeadShift` and
`OrderedCuspidalProductTwistOne`. The complete independent report and
all three Lean files were read during preparation.

The separately published fixed-product construction
`CuspidalProductDetectedConstituent` was also verified against its frozen
reviewed pair, but it is not imported or used here. Its uniqueness
conclusion for detected constituents of one ambient product does not
supply irreducibility of a special-head product.

The other five direct imports are existing published Library pairs.
The decreasing embedding, decreasing factors, head-finiteness and
general top-line interfaces were inspected together with their paired
Markdown and the previously recorded lower proof routes. They are reused
by Lean name; their published source files are unchanged.

## Complete import closure

A native recursive inventory follows project imports from the six
direct imports below and this new module, stopping at the named external
Mathlib/Lean import roots. It strips nested block comments, line comments
and string literals before scanning Lean code. It records each project's
direct imports and SHA256 values for both its Lean and Markdown files.
There are 1,094 project modules including this root and 296 distinct
external import roots. All 1,093 inherited Lean/Markdown pairs are
byte-identical to the audit Library. There are no missing project modules
or missing paired Markdown files.

| Direct import, prefixed by `Langlands.Representation.` | Project closure, including that import | Role in this module |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `Classification.SegmentHeadDecreasingSocle` | 652 | Actual injective intertwiner from the supplied head into decreasing induction |
| `Classification.SegmentDecreasingCuspidalProduct` | 89 | Actual supercuspidal factors, equality of induced objects and the ordered one-twist separation |
| `Classification.SegmentHeadProductFiniteness` | 496 | Extract irreducibility from the supplied relation and derive admissibility |
| `Derivative.OrderedCuspidalProductNondegeneracyProof` | 906 | Nonvanishing of the top derivative of every nonzero mirabolic subrepresentation of the ordered product |
| `Derivative.RestrictionBridge` | 85 | Identify the derivative of the restriction with the actual general-linear derivative |
| `Derivative.TopLine` | 304 | Scalar model of the entire nonzero top derivative of an admissible irreducible representation |

The complete project-module listing and the external import roots are in
the appendices. Closure sizes overlap and are not additive.

The inherited set is exactly the union of the earlier BZ proof,
conditional head-line and decreasing-embedding inventories, omitting the
private probe root `Worker357HeadTopProbe`. Every overlapping inherited
Lean and Markdown hash equals its earlier inventory hash. Thus adding
the actual BZ proof introduces its previously audited general-theory
closure, without any unexplained inherited module or changed source.

For reproducibility, the private inventory is
`.private/notes/worker357-head-top-actual-import-audit-2026-11-01.json`.
The three earlier inventories have SHA256 values
`ba112bdb91cc09ccbf468f641dc2602a48d061266a9f7b37ea24fb28bb4d88ee`
(BZ),
`b67e77dbd4d1644f2cb8dc10289a289924c78eddb80c5bb286329471a08f863d`
(conditional head-line), and
`eef7cde4c979237382598ca928a435d9172b065a8c1f77096ffcb35d4971cf82`
(decreasing embedding). These private records are preparation evidence;
the public appendices and import graph allow the closure to be
reconstructed without them. The inventory describes source coverage,
not a claim to have reread every inherited file line by line.

## Mathematical dependency audit

The direct dependencies have the following implemented proof routes.
These checks supplement the identifier scan, which by itself cannot
exclude a renamed circular theorem.

1. **The supplied head and its decreasing embedding.** The strong head
   relation already contains irreducibility and an actual representing
   supercuspidal object. The published individual constituent existence
   proof constructs a common image of a nonzero map between increasing
   and decreasing induction. Actual geometric-lemma filtrations,
   cuspidal Jacquet multiplicity, and detection of every nonzero
   subobject and quotient force that image to have length one and the
   required strong endpoint properties. Canonical-head equivalences
   identify any supplied head with this image; their composition
   transports the actual injection into decreasing induction. The
   lower detection proofs use first and second adjointness and actual
   coinvariant exactness. They do not use a full or two-block
   special-head Jacquet formula. The second-adjointness route uses
   induction duality and canonical-lift pairings. Its
   `UnitaryDualJacquetSupportAdapters` import contributes elementary
   compact-open cofinality, without a tempered classification theorem.

2. **The decreasing family.** Its factors are the actual twists
   `segmentSupercuspidalFactor F T A (m - 1 - i)`.
   The object equalities are reflexive. Equality of a later class with
   the positive one-twist of an earlier class would force equality of
   the corresponding integer exponents by
   `cuspidalDatum_integralTwist_injective`; finite-index arithmetic
   contradicts it. Integral-twist freeness is proved using the
   admissible Schur central character evaluated at a scalar
   uniformizer. This branch uses neither derivatives nor an individual
   segment derivative or Jacquet formula.

3. **BZ77 Theorem 4.11.** The published proof inducts on the number of
   supercuspidal blocks. Its invariant is homogeneity of the mirabolic
   restriction together with dimension one of the whole top
   derivative. General BZ77 4.4 handles one supercuspidal block; the
   general Leibniz filtration gives the top dimension of a binary
   product. Head/tail regrouping identifies the actual block product
   with that binary product. For arbitrary nonzero submodules,
   the restriction short exact sequence splits the argument according
   to their intersection with its kernel. General mixed-product
   derivative compatibility, detection and exactness handle the
   nonzero-intersection case. In the other case, general Ze80 5.3
   gives homogeneity, so the highest nonzero derivative injects into
   the first irreducible supercuspidal block. Its support is then
   constrained by the published BZ77 Lemma 4.7(b). The ordered
   condition rules this out; the same-index case is excluded by a
   separate central-character proof of `νρ ≠ ρ`. No irreducible
   submodule is selected inside an arbitrary derivative and no
   finite-length hypothesis on mirabolic representations is used.

4. **General comparisons inside BZ 4.11.** The Lemma 4.7(b) branch uses
   `CuspidalProductDerivativeQuotientSupport`, `WholeLeviTransport`,
   and the proved general derivative/Jacquet comparison Ze80 3.7(b).
   The other additional source theorem is general Ze80 5.3
   `leftMixedProductHomogeneity`. The producer's full closure and
   source/owner audit is recorded in the published
   [BZ proof Markdown](../Derivative/OrderedCuspidalProductNondegeneracyProof.md).
   The operator response cited above explicitly permits both branches
   for this consumer after publication. Neither is a segment
   derivative or segment-head Jacquet formula.

5. **Admissibility and the top scalar model.** This module uses only
   `IsSegmentHead.isIrreducible` and `IsSegmentHead.isAdmissible` from
   the head-finiteness import. The latter obtains admissibility from
   the general cuspidal embedding theorem for an irreducible smooth
   representation. The larger imported finite-length branch embeds
   arbitrary irreducible-factor products into cuspidal induction,
   whose finite length is proved with geometric filtrations and a
   finite Jacquet detecting family. General composition-series and
   multiplicity APIs account for its remaining filtration imports.
   None of those length conclusions is applied in the present proof.
   The top scalar model uses general Gelfand–Kazhdan multiplicity one
   for an admissible irreducible representation. Pullback of the full
   algebraic dual along the surjective top quotient, followed by
   separation of points by the dual, proves dimension one from
   nonvanishing. It does not presume finite-dimensionality of the
   derivative. Finite-dimensionality is derived before choosing the
   scalar equivalence.

6. **The new composition.** The actual restricted injection has a
   nonzero range because its source is nontrivial. BZ 4.11 is applied
   to that range, with the actual decreasing family and its proved
   order condition. Functorial transport through `isoRange` and the
   restriction bridge give precisely the desired full derivative
   object. No exactness, finite length, naturality or formula for
   intermediate derivatives is assumed by either public declaration.

## Authorized general infrastructure and retained exclusions

The nine modules covered by the operator's infrastructure ruling are
present with unchanged published bytes. The following table records
their contents and entry routes; none supplies an excluded conclusion.
Module prefixes are `Langlands.Representation.` except for the
combinatorial module.

| Module | Generic content and entry route |
| --- | --- |
| `Filtration.ObjectTransport` | Transport of actual filtrations along group maps and representation equivalences; reached through the mixed-product level APIs |
| `Tensor.FiniteFiltration` | Tensor-slot filtrations and their actual graded-piece equivalences; same route |
| `Tensor.ExternalFiltration` | External tensor-slot filtrations; same route |
| `Tensor.ExternalSubrepresentation` | Subrepresentations obtained from one tensor slot, with zero, top, order and properness lemmas; same route |
| `Parabolic.InductionSubrepresentation` | Actual induction of a subrepresentation and its order/properness lemmas; same route |
| `Parabolic.ProductInductionSubrepresentation` | Actual slot-induced subrepresentations of block products; same route |
| `Langlands.Combinatorics.RelationInversions` | List pair counts and inversions; reached through the Gelfand–Kazhdan Bruhat argument |
| `Derivative.MirabolicMinusNormalization` | Haar and half-modulus character identities for the general minus functors; reached through the Ze80 5.3 proof |
| `Classification.SupercuspidalDerivativesStatement` | The isolated Prop-valued BZ77 4.4 statement; its independently published proof supplies the theorem |

The first seven were introduced under socle-exhaustion task
`f3a69bc8-7312-4f82-8a7d-ea3c8188cb63`; the normalization adapter under
two-supercuspidal task `3c9849a4-a6c0-43ac-9982-d15ed76bf1e9`;
the isolated cuspidal statement under
`8e5b4563-0365-41c7-b134-70f2a0b36292`. The published BZ Markdown
identifies their introducing artifacts, project imports and owner
checks. The operator's response expressly distinguishes these generic
modules from those tasks' excluded mathematical conclusions.
The new composition uses the resulting general proof, without invoking
any of those excluded conclusions.

`Classification.Supercuspidal*` modules in the closure supply cuspidal
objects, twists, supports, duals, admissibility and independently proved
cuspidal derivatives. `Whittaker.Algebraic`, `Whittaker.GeneralLinear`
and `Whittaker.Iwasawa` supply models and functionals; their proof branch
is general Gelfand–Kazhdan multiplicity one. No Whittaker
coinvariant-finiteness statement is imported. The essential and tempered
modules supply definitions and elementary adapters, with no
square-integrable or tempered classification conclusion.

The comment-free recursive scan for both statement and theorem spellings
of the host exclusions and the additional derivative-route exclusions
has no hits. The proof routes above and the earlier independent reviews
preserve the following exclusions, including proof successors,
renamings and transitive uses:

| Excluded conclusion | Dependency check |
| --- | --- |
| Parent `GenericSegmentProductUniqueness`, task `30341ae4-65f2-4a0e-9283-763db01a409e` | No import or proof use |
| Multisegment exhaustion, task `3bfb61fa-1129-4fc9-83fd-7fcfec22106e` | No import or proof use |
| Ordered strong-head existence, task `ebea9a8a-9b21-4208-aa31-98c2dea1f8a3` | No import or proof use; the independent individual-segment existence proof is a different result |
| Quotient coverage, task `20e4e1c6-0f4f-4ca7-96b9-a214ba1a7584` | No import or proof use |
| Ordered conversion, task `8252833d-c269-41a9-824c-5879e531b23b` | No import or proof use |
| Tempered uniqueness, task `52e97845-36bb-457d-b76f-70753334b88c` | No import or proof use |
| `SquareIntegrableLanglandsClassification`, task `1cb45da2-7007-4351-a694-594fb148b8d1` | No import or proof use |
| Square-integrable exhaustion, task `cd8ab97c-0b78-4bce-97c4-d307a28159a4` | No import or proof use |
| Regular exhaustion, task `bf433f0a-921a-428c-b0c0-6475438125ac` | No import or proof use |
| Ze80 segment derivative formulas 3.5 and 9.6, including segment-socle derivatives from `8e5b4563-0365-41c7-b134-70f2a0b36292` | No import or proof use; only the isolated proved cuspidal derivative route and authorized general comparison are used |
| Full/head/socle segment Jacquet formulas and exponent-norm formula, tasks `ed48ae06-964c-4c84-9e62-978f5a953ca7`, `55ad1e10-62d8-46b7-a081-909ef0056426`, `b95105c6-f8bb-4641-ae53-2f49d1e7f034`, `92aea10f-62ac-4e0b-bd4a-9a80909797c5` | No import or proof use; actual cuspidal Jacquet multiplicities and the authorized general derivative/Jacquet comparison are distinct inputs |
| Segment-socle product irreducibility, linked structure, gluing, commutation, swaps and socle exhaustion, including task `2ae5cbe5-0701-4509-88a0-db8cbeb35be4` | No excluded conclusion imported or used; the generic infrastructure intersections are listed above |
| The host special-head product criterion `SegmentHeadProductIrreducibility`, task `8364e73f-14ec-4d14-8f2b-1555a7c1ce95` | Neither its statement module nor a proof of it is imported; already published general constructions from this host do not assume its conclusion |
| Analytic segment classification, special square-integrability, two-supercuspidal product irreducibility or structure, and Whittaker coinvariant finiteness | No excluded conclusion imported or used |
| Unproved statements, conditional draft assemblies or pending proof tasks | No such input is used as a proof; the public BZ premise is discharged by the independently accepted published theorem |

The same scan finds no Lean proof holes or new axioms. Recovery Lake
check `cd895ae9-1c57-42ff-ad30-22a28c1c7cb2` compiled this module
with zero errors and warnings. Inspection of the entry definition
reports precisely the independent level parameters `uF`, `uV` and only
`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`. Compilation and this author
audit are preparation evidence; the new construction still requires its
own independent semantic review and publication.

The remaining product criterion needs further arguments about
intermediate derivatives, all irreducible subquotients, and linked
segments. Neither its sufficient direction nor its converse is asserted
here.
