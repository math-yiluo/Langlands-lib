# Irreducibility of products of special segment heads

Author: Worker 357.

`Langlands.Classification.segmentHeadProductIrreducibility` proves exactly
`Langlands.Classification.SegmentHeadProductIrreducibility.{uF,uV} F T`
from the unchanged published `SegmentGenericStatement`. A finite product of
supplied special heads is irreducible if and only if its segment multiset is
unlinked. Both implications cover arbitrary finite families, with repeated
segments retained.

## Statement and conventions

The theorem has outer parameters
`{p : ℕ} [Fact p.Prime] (F : PadicField.{uF} p) (T : F.TopologicalData)`.
It adds no premise. Unfolding the named target and installing `T.topology`,
its assertion is

```text
∀ (n : ℕ) (d : T.SegmentProductDatum.{uV,uF} (n+1)),
  d.HasSegmentHeads →
    (Representation.IsIrreducible d.induced.representation ↔
      d.multisegment.IsUnlinked).
```

Every positive ambient rank, including rank one, is covered. The field
universe `uF` and the original supercuspidal carrier universe `uV` remain
independent. Segment bases stay in `Type uV`; supplied heads, products and
derivatives have carriers in `Type (max uF uV)`. No resizing or saturation
of the target's `uV` is used. The field, supplied topology, complex
coefficients, matrix groups, smooth actions, inductions and intertwiners
are the actual Library constructions.

For `Δ = [ρ,ν^(m-1)ρ]`, where `ν = |det|` uses the residue-normalized
absolute value, `IsSegmentHead Δ π` is the strong irreducible head of
increasing induction `ρ × νρ × … × ν^(m-1)ρ`, Zelevinsky's special
representation from §9.1. Its distinction from the socle of that induction
is preserved. `HasSegmentHeads` is this condition at each supplied block.
Products use the existing upper block parabolic, positive half-modulus
normalization and right-translation action.

`d.multisegment` is the multiset of `List.ofFn d.segments`. `IsUnlinked`
forbids linkage between any two members; linkage means noncontainment in
both directions and a union that is a segment. A segment is not linked to
itself, so repetitions are allowed. No precedence order on the whole
family is imposed.

## Implemented proof

The final theorem chooses an actual allowed additive character with
`HarmonicAnalysis.padicUnitaryAdditiveCharacterExists F T` and obtains the
proved `cuspidalIntegralTwistFreeness F T`. Neither is an additional
hypothesis of the criterion.

### Sufficiency

For `hu : d.multisegment.IsUnlinked`, apply the published
`unlinkedSegmentHeadProduct_isIrreducible T ψ d hd hu`. Its proof is
documented in `UnlinkedSegmentHeadProduct.md` and follows this route.
For every irreducible actual subquotient `Q` of the product, general BZ77
theory supplies a highest positive derivative order `k`. If it is smaller
than the ambient rank, its residual rank is positive. Finite length and
the general highest-derivative pairing supply an irreducible invariant
subspace `S` of that derivative and an actual quotient of the corresponding
derivative of `Q.contragredient` onto `S.contragredient` twisted by
`ν^(-1)`. Admissible duality identifies the dual of this target with `ν S`.

The published shifted-support construction applies the final support-only
terminal-truncation bound to these actual occurrences and the individual
head contragredient comparison. Supercuspidal support uniqueness gives a
nonempty shifted equality between unions of terminal and initial
truncations of the original segments. Finite segment combinatorics then
produce a linked pair of original indices, contradicting `hu`. Thus every
such `Q` has nonzero derivative at the whole top order.

The whole top derivative of the head product is a complex line. General
derivative exactness, finite length and nonvanishing on every irreducible
subquotient force the original product to be irreducible. Detection of
**every** simple subquotient is part of the proof; top nonvanishing alone
would not suffice. No entire intermediate highest derivative is assumed
irreducible.

### The linked binary contradiction

The new private `precedingHeadProduct_not_irreducible` takes
`Δ.Precedes Γ`, a union/intersection replacement `U,I`, and supplied heads
`π,τ`. The optional intersection `I` includes the disjoint, juxtaposed
case. Assume the actual binary product `π × τ` is irreducible.

1. `segmentBinaryHeadDatum` packages exactly the two supplied blocks as
   a datum `b` at rank `N = Δ.degree + Γ.degree`, retaining its actual
   binary equivalence, head proofs and exact cuspidal multiset
   `Δ.cuspidalContent + Γ.cuspidalContent`. Transport the assumed
   irreducibility along that equivalence.
2. `segmentHeadReplacementDatum` chooses actual individual heads for
   `U :: I.toList`, giving a datum `r` at rank `N`. Integral twist
   freeness and the union/intersection count identity prove equality of
   the two cuspidal multisets, with all overlap multiplicities retained.
3. `segmentHeadProductComparison` uses that content equality and
   irreducibility of `b.datum.induced` to identify the original product
   with a detected actual constituent of the replacement. Hence the
   original is an actual smooth subquotient of the replacement.
   Its `derivative_isSubquotient` projection preserves this relation
   under every feasible actual derivative, by general exactness.
4. `linkedReplacementDerivativeObstruction` chooses a concrete terminal
   witness `w` for the same replacement. Apply
   `linkedHeadDerivativeOccurrence` to **that exact witness**. It gives
   a supplied residual head `H` for `w.segment` occurring in the derivative
   of the original binary product at order
   `k = w.cut * Δ.rank + Γ.degree`, with `k < N`.
   The occurrence comes from an actual cut-derivative quotient of the
   first head, the second head's full top nontriviality, and a quotient of
   a Leibniz filtration piece. The published construction includes cut zero.
5. Cast `H` along the retained rank equality to an object `D` at rank
   `N-k`. Map the binary equivalence through that same derivative and
   compose actual smooth subquotients. This makes `D` an actual
   constituent of the order-`k` derivative of `r.datum.induced`.
6. The new private `suppliedHeadCuspidalSupport` proves that a supplied
   head has its segment's cuspidal content as support. Choose the
   supercuspidal representative in its primitive head relation, twist it
   at each segment member, verify the degree sum, and regard the given
   quotient of increasing induction as a subquotient. This uses no
   segment support or derivative formula. The private
   `rankCast_irreducible` and `rankCast_support` eliminate equality of
   natural ranks, preserving irreducibility and that support for `D`.
   Cuspidal-content membership is exactly witness-support membership.
7. Apply `obstruction.nonoccurrence` to the replacement datum as its own
   reflexive subquotient, to this irreducible `D` and to that exact support.
   It contradicts the occurrence just constructed.

The obstruction uses the final published support-only bound: a simple
constituent in a replacement derivative has support equal to a union of
optional terminal truncations of `U` and `I`. Support uniqueness identifies
it with the witness support, which the finite terminal-witness construction
forbids. The **original** linked pair provides occurrence; the
**replacement** provides nonoccurrence. The replacement is never assumed
irreducible.

### Necessity for any finite family

The private `twoBlockHeadProduct_not_irreducible` adapts the binary argument
to any datum whose complete ordered block list is exactly
`[⟨Δ,π⟩,⟨Γ,τ⟩]`. This is also definitionally the block list of the binary
datum. `inducedEquivOfBlockListEq` followed by the binary equivalence gives
an actual product equivalence. The finite construction
`Segment.exists_unionIntersectionReplacement` supplies `U,I`, so transport
of irreducibility would contradict the binary helper.

If the whole `d` is irreducible and two members of its multisegment are
linked, unpack both memberships to actual occurrence indices `i,j`.
Self-nonlinkage proves `i ≠ j`. `IsLinked.precedes_or_precedes` orients the
pair. The published `segmentHeadProductPairReduction` extracts an
irreducible two-block datum at their summed degree, with complete block
list exactly `[d.blockAt i,d.blockAt j]`, or the reversed list.
Its `blocks_eq` and `irreducible` fields contradict the two-block helper.
Thus `d.multisegment.IsUnlinked`.

Pair extraction separately retains an actual equivalence from the whole
product to a permutation placing these occurrences first. It regroups the
whole product and reflects simplicity to the two-factor inner induction
using proper nonzero induced slot subspaces. It does not identify the
whole product with the extracted pair. Equal segment occurrences remain
distinct indices; neither enumeration nor reduction discards multiplicity.
The final theorem pairs this necessity with sufficiency, proving the full
existing `iff` at its original universes.

## Original source and implemented route

The direct source is A. V. Zelevinsky, *Induced representations of reductive
p-adic groups II. On irreducible representations of GL(n)*, Ann. Sci. ENS
(4) 13 (1980), 165–210, registered as `zelevinsky-1980-induced-ii`, SHA256
`663c79f2ee236626385d242d83107410c1a3291ba5584d4b8abee9cf8af428ac`.
The retained original is
`/home/taskhub/central-library/Zelevinsky--Induced representations of reductive p-adic groups II, irreducible representations of GL(n)--1980.pdf`.
The author read §9.1, printed p.197, and Theorem 9.7(a) with the complete
§§9.8–9.9, printed pp.199–201. No applicable registered errata entry was
found in the supplied literature index or public notes.

The target is the irreducibility clause of Theorem 9.7(a). The separate
nondegeneracy clause is outside this target. Section 9.1 fixes the special
head convention. Section 9.8 rules out a degenerate composition factor using
terminal/initial truncations and a finite linkage obstruction. Section 9.9
reduces necessity to a linked pair and distinguishes it from its
union/intersection replacement by a derivative constituent; the original
occurrence and replacement nonoccurrence appear on printed p.201.

This proof retains those combinatorial obstructions but changes the
representation-theoretic inputs. The printed argument uses 9.6 in §9.8
and the classification comparisons 8.4 and 9.1 in §9.9. This proof consumes
none of those conclusions as a proved input. It uses independently proved
general BZ77 derivative and duality infrastructure, the final support-only
bound, actual cut and Leibniz quotient occurrences, and the fixed-support
detected-constituent comparison. That comparison is proved using general
cuspidal induction factor matching and exact scalar-top detection, without
uniqueness of segment multisets or downstream classification.

The general theory is from Bernstein–Zelevinsky, *Induced representations
of reductive p-adic groups I*, Ann. Sci. ENS (4) 10 (1977), 441–472,
registered as `bernstein-zelevinsky-1977-induced-i`, SHA256
`8424600228ab72c5937e45edceefcae410a2a0b8f5ebf282185691542aa89092`.
The published input pairs record their original passages for derivative
exactness, Leibniz, Gelfand–Kazhdan, highest-derivative pairing and Theorem
4.2. The private helpers in this module are internal support/rank
transports and compositions of those published actual maps, with no
additional external assumption.

The inherited used-body audits in these Markdown pairs cover their general
lower modules. In particular, fixed-support comparison reindexes actual
cuspidal occurrences, uses general associated-cuspidal induction factor
matching, and compares detected constituents of one fixed cuspidal product.
Pair reduction uses general two-factor constituent commutativity obtained
from inverse transpose, smooth duality, Gelfand–Kazhdan and finite
composition series. Whole-product irreducibility upgrades factor matching
to an actual equivalence before regrouping. Neither route consumes
segment-product uniqueness.

Cut occurrence uses the permitted individual-head embedding, the general
derivative quotient of an actual induced map, tensor contraction,
individual-head top nontriviality and the general Leibniz filtration.
Sufficiency uses a simple subspace and dual quotient of a highest
derivative, rather than a full derivative identification. The support
branch invokes the final `segmentHeadDerivativeSupportTruncation` through
the product terminal/dual-support adapters only.

These rulings specify eligible foundations; they supply no mathematical
premise. All inherited mathematics is reused by published Lean name.
No pending contribution or reused peer draft is consumed.

The full recursive inventory below is against Library
`0bd5bf67c3464359bc8da3b3100163d6ee3da352`: 1344 project modules, including
this new root, and 324 distinct external frontier imports. All 1343
inherited Lean/Markdown pairs are byte-identical to that Library. There are
no missing project imports or missing or empty paired Markdown files.
Scanning code with nested comments and strings removed finds no proof
holes, new axioms or prohibited executable syntax. The external list is
the project boundary, not a second recursive Mathlib inventory. This audit
combines published lower used-body audits, direct-interface inspection,
recursive byte comparison and name scans; it does not claim every inherited
file was reread line by line in this final assembly.

The closure includes the authorized final support theorem and its internal
helpers. Removing `SegmentHeadDerivativeSupportTruncationProof` from
traversal removes `SegmentHeadSupportStep`,
`SegmentHeadDerivativeSupportLengthTwo`,
`TwoSupercuspidalAdjacentReducibilityProof` and
`TwoSupercuspidalNonadjacentIrreducibilityProof` entirely. Thus these
restricted modules enter solely through the final support proof. This
host invokes none of their restricted intermediate results separately.
`SegmentHeadJacquetReduction` and `TwoSupercuspidalProductStructureProof`
are absent. Broad `TwoSupercuspidalProductStructureStatement` Prop
interfaces in that restricted closure supply no assumed structure theorem.

The mandatory target import `SegmentGenericStatement` also defines
`GenericSegmentProductUniqueness`, `SegmentSocleProductIrreducibility` and
other Prop interfaces. Those definitions occur because the exact target
resides in the same unchanged module. None is assumed or applied as a
proof, and no proof of those excluded conclusions is imported. Inherited
tempered, segment-socle and classification data predicates likewise carry
no proved classification premise.

The mathematical dependency closure is independent of the parent
`GenericSegmentProductUniqueness` task
`30341ae4-65f2-4a0e-9283-763db01a409e` and its conclusion;
multisegment exhaustion `3bfb61fa-1129-4fc9-83fd-7fcfec22106e`;
ordered strong-head existence `ebea9a8a-9b21-4208-aa31-98c2dea1f8a3`;

ordered conversion `8252833d-c269-41a9-824c-5879e531b23b`;
tempered uniqueness `52e97845-36bb-457d-b76f-70753334b88c`;
`SquareIntegrableLanglandsClassification` and task
`1cb45da2-7007-4351-a694-594fb148b8d1`;
square-integrable exhaustion `cd8ab97c-0b78-4bce-97c4-d307a28159a4`;
and regular exhaustion `bf433f0a-921a-428c-b0c0-6475438125ac`.
It uses neither Ze80 3.5/9.6 nor their proof successors, the excluded
segment/head/socle and full Jacquet conclusions, nor the segment-socle
part of task `8e5b4563-0365-41c7-b134-70f2a0b36292`. Both directions of
this host criterion are absent as inherited inputs; this root proves both.

General `Representation.Derivative` and `Representation.Mirabolic` modules
are present and permitted. Generic matrix-subgroup modules under
`Group.GL.Mirabolic`, including the pair-reduction closure's group modules,
are also present. They supply no forbidden segment formula. The inventories
below list those imports explicitly.

## Validation and scope

Full-module development compilation succeeds with zero errors and warnings
in environment `3b864ddf-f0af-4c18-8903-c6f813a0ce0f`. Declaration
inspection reports a theorem with independent levels `uF,uV` and only
`propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`. The Lean theorem returns the
named target in its source. Development checks are author evidence;
exact-target candidate validation, independent semantic review and Library
publication remain separate admission requirements.

Only this new Lean/Markdown pair is submitted. No existing statement or
imported pair is edited. The result proves the criterion for supplied
special heads in arbitrary finite families; it adds no exhaustion,
uniqueness or classification assertion.
