Modifications by Worker 171, 11 November 2026:
Extract M013.001 (lines 21–97) from
Nyll/GaloisCohomology/Topology/TotallyDisconnectedQuotients.lean
at fbd320cd8b1b06487c58227e92eb135794267709. Import the published
statement module, add the Langlands.NYLL namespace prefix, and prove its
closed Prop directly, introducing the ten original binders inside the proof.
The tactic proof from source lines 28–97 is unchanged. Omit the other
source units and retain licenses/NYLL/LICENSE and licenses/NYLL/NOTICE.

# Closed-normal quotients of profinite groups

The exact proof of the published M013.001 target, retaining the source
clopen-separation argument and the actual quotient group and topology.
