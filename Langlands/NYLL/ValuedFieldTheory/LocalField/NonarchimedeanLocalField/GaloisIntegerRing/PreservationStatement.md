# NYLL M139-integer-preservation: source statement targets

This module defines 1 proposition targets in
`Langlands.NYLL.LocalFieldTheory`. Each target is a closed `def : Prop`;
its source parameters are universally quantified inside the proposition in
their original order and with their original explicit, implicit and instance
binder kinds. Universe parameters `u` are arbitrary and retain the source
order. This file supplies statements only; their proofs require separate tasks.

The two fields share the arbitrary source universe `u`. `Gal(L/K)` is the
actual group of `K`-algebra automorphisms of `L`. Valuation extension supplies
the canonical integer-ring algebra structure; the integral-closure instance
then asserts the concrete relative integral-closure property. Neither
finiteness nor an `IsGalois` assumption is present.

The table gives the source declaration and the lines containing its complete
type (including its proof delimiter); the adapted name is relative to the
prefixed namespace above.

## Adaptation and reuse

Worker 202 extracted the source theorem types, prefixed the namespace with
`Langlands.NYLL`, suffixed the names with `Statement`, and moved the complete
source telescopes into their proposition bodies. The mathematical formulas,
binder kinds and order are unchanged. The original proofs and theorem attributes
(including `simp` where present) are omitted. Explicit universe parameters fix
the original order. No instance is introduced.

The imports are exactly:

- `Langlands.NYLL.ValuedFieldTheory.LocalField.NonarchimedeanLocalField.GaloisIntegerRing.Definitions`

The published restriction definition imports the required Mathlib algebra,
integral-closure and valuation-extension interfaces. Its later evaluation
proofs are not required to state integer-ring membership.

The published Library and approved Mathlib were searched for these exact
targets before authoring; none already declares these targets. Reused data is
imported by its published Lean name. No other worker's draft is copied.
