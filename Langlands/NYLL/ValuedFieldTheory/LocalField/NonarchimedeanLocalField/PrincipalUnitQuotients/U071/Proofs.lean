Extract the proof of M132.071 from
Nyll/ValuedFieldTheory/LocalField/NonarchimedeanLocalField/PrincipalUnitQuotients.lean
at fbd320cd8b1b06487c58227e92eb135794267709, lines 946–960. Add the Langlands.NYLL
namespace prefix. Keep the source telescope and give the theorem the published
target applied to its parameters as its type; a leading `show` unfolds that target
to the source conclusion, after which the original proof is followed unchanged.
Import only QuotientAlgebraStatements. Omit the source noncomputable section and
all other source declarations. The original LICENSE and NOTICE are retained in
