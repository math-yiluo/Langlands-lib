Every unqualified original name above is in `LocalClassFieldTheory`; every
adapted name is in `Langlands.NYLL.LocalClassFieldTheory` unless fully qualified.

Prefix the namespace; replace the source theorem by its exact Prop-valued `Statement` definition; omit the proof and `simp` attribute. Preserve the source `omit [IsGalois k Ω]`, all binders and their order. Use the focused sibling definition import.

The target says that projecting the forward equivalence to the ambient additive unit group is exactly `intermediateFieldUnitsToGaloisAmbient`. The statement claims no proof.
