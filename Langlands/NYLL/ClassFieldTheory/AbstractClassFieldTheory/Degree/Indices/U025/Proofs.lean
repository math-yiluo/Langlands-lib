# Cardinal image–kernel factorization

Modified by Worker 189: extract M006.025 from the pinned NYLL source,
prefix the namespace by Langlands.NYLL, state the theorem using its exact
published Statement, and import the separately published prerequisite proofs.
Preserve the saturated-subgroup proof, independent universes and all hypotheses.
