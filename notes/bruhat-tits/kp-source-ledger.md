# KP Bundles A–B: source ledger and construction boundaries

This source ledger covers Bundle A and the initial Bundle B targets of the standing KP program
`f33d727f-04b8-4fd2-9e9f-2f5c4eb2a703`. It records mathematical source targets,
not completed formalization. Every formal-status field below is empty: no
accepted, published Lean result for these complete targets has been verified in
this ledger. The remaining Bundle B targets and Bundles C–F still require their own ledger entries and original-source audits.

The normative sources are Kaletha–Prasad, *Bruhat–Tits Theory: A New Approach*
(2023), registered as `kaletha-prasad-2023-bruhat-tits-new-approach`, and the
authors' corrections of 1 November 2024, registered as
`kaletha-prasad-2024-corrections`. Both readable originals are in
`/home/taskhub/central-library/Kaletha-Prasad--Bruhat-Tits theory, a new approach (book)--2023/`.
Their fingerprints and precise locators are included in every relevant row.
The operator roadmap is design guidance, not theorem evidence.

## Reading and scope

The original passages behind these rows were read at PDF pages 34–40, 161–163,
188, 199–205 and 213–215, together with corrections PDF pages 1–3, 25 and 27–29.
Book PDF pages 35–36 and 202 were visually checked. In particular, the overbar
in Theorem 4.2.10 matters: the closed union is a union of **facet closures**.
The OCR text alone drops that overbar. The theorem does not require the building
to be locally finite; that is only the first case in its proof.

The Chapter 4 targets are consequences of specified building axioms. They do
not supply a general reductive-group building construction. The program still
requires the descended construction and every corrected axiom in its
Theorem 9.2.7 certificate. None of the source-only rows below closes that boundary.

For the initial Bundle B extension, the original-source audit also covered book
PDF pages 188–197, 266–267, 280–292, 307, 353–360 and 393–399, and
corrections PDF pages 27, 30–41. Axiom 4.1.22 at PDF page 195 was visually
checked to distinguish the special fibre from its maximal reductive quotient.
The extension has three new rows: corrected Definition 4.1.26, Theorem 7.5.3
and Theorem 9.2.7. Source references in the assembly map below are dependencies
of those rows; they are not additional completed formal targets.

## Structured ledger

The JSON block is the structured ledger. Each row has the same fields.
`lean_declarations`, `modules`, acceptance, publication and trust reports stay
empty until their exact results have been verified. An owner task records an
obligation; it is not evidence of its fulfillment. Conditional code will remain
`conditional` until its missing instance is constructed.

## Bundle B: the complete certificate and its source map

The corrected Definition 4.1.26 is the ten-axiom target. The following table
records the source assembly of §9.5 and the extra routes needed to retain its
full corrected scope. It is a source-derived proof plan, not a Lean proof,
axiom report or claim of acceptance. In particular, the shorter printed list
in Theorem 9.2.7 does not reduce the program's certificate.

| Certificate item | Source route and boundary |
| --- | --- |
| 4.1.1 | Theorem 9.3.21, with apartments and facets constructed in §9.2. |
| 4.1.2 | The corresponding assertion for the constructed quasi-split group G_K. |
| 4.1.4 | Proposition 9.3.16. |
| 4.1.6 | AS1: 9.4.9; AS2–3: 9.4.19; AS4: 9.4.18; AS5: 9.4.35 and its preceding paragraph; AS6: 9.4.31. Apply the corrected inclusion of the identity in AS3. |
| 4.1.8 | Proposition 9.4.3 and Lemmas 9.4.6, 9.4.21. Part (2) retains a nonempty bounded subset. |
| 4.1.9 | Propositions 9.3.24–9.3.25, with the corrected restricted-building argument for 9.3.25. |
| 4.1.16 | The derived route through 9.6.5–9.6.6, corrected 4.4.5, 7.3.12 and 7.4.9, explained below; no separate paragraph for this axiom appears in the printed §9.5. |
| 4.1.17 | Proposition 7.9.5 has the scope of all covering field/group isomorphisms. Section 9.5 invokes it for the Gamma action. The full certificate must also transport the descended fixed loci, apartments and models under every such pair, not merely construct that one action. |
| 4.1.20 | Actual model descent in 9.2.5 and the integral-point identities in §9.5. Use 9.3.24 for the G(k)^0 intersection law; G(k)^1 has its own law. |
| 4.1.22 | Parts (1), (2), (7) descend geometrically; (7) uses perfect residue to descend the unipotent radical. Parts (3), (5) use facet correspondence and 9.4.31; (4) is 9.3.3; (6) is 9.4.23. |
| 4.1.27 | Fixed-locus and base-change constructions in §9.2, special tori from 9.3.4, and affine-root compatibility from 9.4.28. Retain all four clauses, including both integral-model intersection identities. |

Chapter 7 cannot supply a general existence theorem merely from a valuation
hypothesis. The corrections at PDF page 33 add **AS5 of Axiom 4.1.6** to its
ambient assumptions; PDF page 35 replaces the Weyl-identification arguments in
7.5.1 by this assumption. In the perfect-residue case, Proposition 9.4.35
establishes AS5 from the descended geometry before §9.6 constructs valuations.
The Iwahori–Tits systems of 7.5.3 are systems in G(k)^0 and G(k)^natural.
They do not erase the component or length-zero data of the full G(k) theory.

For the derived 4.1.16 route, Theorem 9.6.5 constructs root-datum valuations
compatible with the field valuation. Section 9.6.6 compares the descended
building with the Chapter 7 building made from those valuations. It identifies
affine roots and proves equality of the G(k)^0 stabilizers at **every** pair
of corresponding apartment points, using 9.4.21 and 7.6.4 and, for multipliable
roots, 6.3.8. This is the universal hypothesis required by corrected Corollary
4.4.5. The comparison needs Axioms 4.1.1, 4.1.4 and 4.1.9, already supplied
in the source assembly; it does not assume the missing Iwahori decomposition.

In the Chapter 7 construction, Corollary 7.4.9 gives the sharp-subgroup
factorization. The full bijections in Axiom 4.1.16 additionally use the
Z(k)^0 factor in 7.4.1, the root-factor bijections of 7.3.12(3), (5), and
injectivity of multiplication in the algebraic open cell. Transport these
factorizations through the comparison. For each fixed positive or negative
system, nondivisible root factors may be ordered arbitrarily. The three
unipotent/central/unipotent factors may also be permuted: switch the positive
system and use normalization by Z(k)^0. The added mixed-all-roots assertion
7.3.12(6) has the extra hypothesis f(0)>0; it is not needed for these
fixed-sign arbitrary orders and must not be applied at depth zero without
that hypothesis.

The descended models in 9.2.5 are actual smooth affine models obtained from
Fact 2.10.16; their coordinate rings are invariant rings, equivalently the
intersections of the O-coordinate rings with k[G]. Their relative identity
components, special fibres and maximal reductive quotients are separate
objects. For a point x the parahoric is G_x^0(o), which fixes its facet
pointwise and has finite index in the corresponding G(k)^1 facet stabilizer;
it is not identified with the full fixer. The naive G(k)^b intersection law
is false (Example 2.6.31). Likewise, a Gamma-chamber or Gamma-vertex need not
be a chamber or vertex over K. The reduced fixed-locus building remains
distinct from the enlarged building and its invariant central translation
factor.

The correction at PDF page 39 adds a further genuine metric dependency:
a bounded Gamma-stable subgroup of G(K) has a Gamma-fixed fixed point.
The argument uses closed convex fixed loci, the bounded closed convex hull
and Theorem 1.1.15. This does not permit a fixed point to be included as
input in place of constructing it. No formal certificate or general-instance
acceptance is recorded here.

## Initial interfaces and the next mathematical gates

Metric definition child `bd4b31f8-44f8-447c-b747-e26d93a271d1` has a staged
candidate `3baeb443-a6c3-4cdf-9ef8-cce5431d3585`, authored by Worker 1221.
At the parent's latest fetch, its machine validation passed and an approving
semantic review report was present; accepted/public status was still false. Its proposed module is
`Langlands.Geometry.Metric.KPDefinitions`, namespace
`Langlands.Geometry.Metric.KP`. It uses a primitive midpoint inequality and
separates geodesic existence, completeness, convexity and barycenters. Its
radius and joint diameter take values in the extended nonnegative reals; the
finite real readings require explicit boundedness and nonemptiness. The
candidate does not supply the fixed-point theorem. These are staged-interface
pointers, to be rechecked after publication before dependent statements are opened.

The corrected convexity predicate must exclude the empty set. Theorem 1.1.15
requires actual existence and uniqueness of a barycenter, including radius-zero
cases, and a fixed point of every bounded isometric group action (Corollary
1.1.19). Supplying a fixed point as input would not establish those conclusions.
The building application must then prove completeness and nonpositive curvature
of the constructed building.

Derived quotient child `cd3fd695-b511-4653-8f4d-769e99d8aab0` asks for the actual
algebraic quotient, its group action, apartment embedding criterion and exact
stabilizer formula from an explicit covariant subgroup family. It also asks for
comparison maps under a universally quantified subgroup inclusion. This is a
conditional construction prerequisite. A parahoric family and the full quotient
point stabilizer need not coincide. The child must retain the normalizer's
point stabilizer, exhibit a proper-containment example, and avoid inferring a
building isomorphism from quotient surjectivity alone.

The existing algebraic-group program
`2b5e4a00-9d44-49a4-9c89-979fb5b6233e` owns dynamic parabolics, centralizers,
unipotent groups and general algebraic open cells. Its published
`Langlands.GroupScheme.Dynamic.Basic` interface is a reuse input, not by itself
a proof of every assertion of Propositions 2.11.1–3. General open cells require
the source's scheme-theoretic open immersion, beyond an assumed product map or
a split matrix instance. A verified reuse bridge remains required for the complete
source targets in the ledger.

The common field interface remains Mathlib's `IsNonarchimedeanLocalField`.
`Langlands.LocalField.ResidueNormalization` and the existing canonical
`Langlands.PadicField` realization are reuse inputs. Field child
`1453f721-e7ff-4221-87e1-6921dfa200e4` asks for an actual Laurent-series fixture
over every finite field, residue and normalization comparisons, negative
monomial calculations and a characteristic-two test. Its publication as a task
supplies no field theorem. Generic topologies and compact/open integral-point
results remain owned by Conrad program
`886bf565-95e9-4dc6-8a9d-73284a523668`; the KP program constructs its specific
models and later proves the comparisons.

## Trust and release accounting

The host environment is `3b864ddf-f0af-4c18-8903-c6f813a0ce0f`: Lean 4.34.0,
Mathlib `5ed2965256430c3649e86755f9576b54eca72435`. No external project is
adopted by this note. The roadmap's external pins remain survey leads. Any
adoption still requires a focused host compile, a mathematical and dependency
audit, and its exact pin and licence. No theorem-level axiom report is asserted
for an unproved target.

Bundle A is open. Bundles B–F, the general constructed instance, the depth-zero
and positive-depth consumers, regression examples, GL comparisons and Renard
bridges are also open. This source ledger neither narrows those obligations nor
claims that the proposed Chapter V structural interfaces have already been
published in the Renard program.
