# Renard 2026, Chapter V: item-by-item coverage ledger

Worker 1222, executor of the whole-book task
`f5d1f399-a1f8-4ab5-a981-90b92abd4857`, revision 1. This note is the Chapter V
part of the item ledger that the task contract requires, in the format of the published
[Chapter VI](item-ledger-vi.md) and [Chapter VII](item-ledger-vii.md) ledgers. Chapter V
has few headed items: most of its assertions sit in numbered paragraphs. The rows therefore
follow the numbered paragraphs V.1–V.5.5 and the headed items inside them. The note declares
no section complete. A published statement is not a proof; every row keeps the proof status
explicit.

The source is David Renard, *Représentations des groupes réductifs p-adiques*,
French version dated 9 July 2026, registered as
`renard-2026-representations-groupes-reductifs-padiques`, SHA256
`7b539996793b7c3620e72e1e389588eb42d1a8e91d6f68b2eead5c2e2ffc182c`. Printed page
numbers are given first and PDF page numbers second; PDF = printed + 6. Library facts
refer to commit `9951a27f5fd8ebbdc4bbe68eb6be65b1d0c2eb4a` unless stated otherwise.
The V.3.6–V.3.13 rows have a focused 13 November 2026 update against Library
`aae8cb822941fac72c628376bd39754a1bc40b74`. The V.5.3 module-form row has a
separate 13 November update against Library
`a0627c91621a99df78a1079f47cfb76995f077fa`, verified below. Other rows retain
their earlier audit status. These updates distinguish statements, exact proofs
and candidates awaiting integration.

Chapter V is mostly a recall of algebraic-group and Bruhat–Tits theory with section-level
references. The published
[Chapter V structural-inputs ledger](chapter-v-structural-inputs.md) (Worker 164) classifies
those recalled assertions (rows S01–S23) and the book's own deductions (rows D01–D08). This
note gives, for each paragraph, the Library declarations that now state or prove it.

## How the rows were checked

Worker 1222 read Chapter V in the text extraction and checked the displayed formulas with
overlines in the rendered PDF. For each paragraph the Library Markdown files citing it were
listed, and their declarations were read. Proof status comes from a scan of the Library for
theorems whose type is exactly the statement (`proved by`). A `task` entry is a
`lean.proof@1` task whose contract names the statement. Task identifiers are abbreviated to
their first eight hexadecimal digits, or given by task number.

Namespace abbreviations: `GS` = `Langlands.GroupScheme`, `PL` = `Langlands.Plancherel`,
`RC` = `Langlands.Plancherel.RenardCartan`, `RP` = `Langlands.Aubert.General.RepresentedParabolic`,
`RPF` = `Langlands.Aubert.General.RationalPointFamily`, `SC` = `Langlands.BruhatTits.SpecialCompact`.

Status codes, as in the Chapter VI ledger:

- **P**: proved; the named theorem has exactly the statement's type.
- **S**: statement published; a proof task is open.
- **D**: definition or construction.
- **C**: covered by published statements that are stronger or equivalent, or derived from
  them; the row says which.
- **St**: a step of the proof of a stated result.
- **X**: expository, convention or attribution.
- **Rec**: an assertion recalled from the literature with a section-level reference (a row
  S.. of the structural-inputs ledger). The row says whether the Library states it.
- **A**: candidate accepted by review, waiting for integration.
- **R**: candidate staged, under review.
- **G**: genuine gap.

| V.3.1 `M = Z(G, A)` for a split component `A` of `P`, `A = A_M`; Levi subgroups are the centralizers of split tori `A` with `A = A_M` | Related: `GS.DynamicLeviCocharacterRealizationStatement` (the Levi of a dynamic parabolic is the centralizer of a cocharacter), `GS.MinimalParabolicLeviCentralizerStatement` (the minimal case). The split-component form for non-minimal `M` is not stated | Rec (S08); P for the related statements; see the V.3.5 row |

The equalities `N_G(A_M) = N_G(M)` and `Z_G(A_M) = M` for non-minimal `M` are Rec (S08), not stated separately. Related proved statements: `GS.MinimalParabolicLeviCentralizerStatement` (a Levi of a minimal parabolic is the centralizer of a maximal split torus) and `GS.ParabolicRadicalTorusCentralizerLeviStatement` (a Levi is the centralizer of a maximal torus of the radical of `P`, a torus whose maximal split subtorus is `A_M`) |
| V.3.6 `𝔞^*_M = 𝔞^*_G ⊕ (𝔞^G_M)^*` and `𝔞_M = 𝔞_G ⊕ 𝔞^G_M`, for the minimal Levi `M_∅` (a maximal split torus `T`) | `GS.RelativeCentralDirectionsStatement` (conjunction of `RelativeCharacterRootComplementStatement` and `RelativeSplitCentralDirectionsStatement`): the root span and the restricted characters of `G` are complementary in `X^*(T) ⊗ ℝ`, and the split component of `G` embeds with image the common root annihilator | P (both conjuncts) |
| V.3.6 the same decompositions for an arbitrary Levi `M` | `GS.RenardLeviCentralDecompositionStatement` ([statement and scope](../../Langlands/GroupScheme/Rational/RenardLeviCentralDecompositionStatement.md)): over every field, for connected reductive `G`, `M` and actual split components with the compatible morphism diagram, both real restriction bijections, the canonical central-character inclusion, its complement with the literal restriction kernel, and the dual cocharacter complement with the pairing annihilator; both product equivalences have the specified addition formulas | S: published candidate `92aa130e-c278-47d0-8647-615541ba61c5`; exact proof Task 6224 (`423ad442-9268-4104-a37f-3f1d8eb63388`). Realizing the compatible component diagram for every source Levi is separate |

A for the real statement in candidate `89ad3e08-f0ca-4e7e-b9fb-5a257e4a4616`; no proof of that target is claimed |

For the projected generators for non-minimal standard Levis, see its V.3.13 component below |

| V.3.12 the real form: `Δ_∅` is a basis of `(𝔞^G_∅)^*`, the kernel of restriction to `A_G` | `GS.RelativeSplitCentralDirectionsStatement` gives, for every split component `a : A_G → G`, an embedding `f : A_G → T` with `(rationalCharacterRestrictReal f).ker = relativeRootSpanReal i` (and the rational analogue). `GS.RelativeCharacterRootComplementStatement` gives the real complement. Pending `GS.RelativeRealSimpleRootBasisStatement` states a real basis of `relativeRootSpanReal i` indexed by the actual simple roots, vector by vector `α ↦ 1 ⊗ α` | P (kernel identification and complement); A for the real basis in candidate `89ad3e08-f0ca-4e7e-b9fb-5a257e4a4616` |
| V.3.12 `Δ_∅^∨` is a basis of `𝔞^G_∅`; fundamental weights and coweights | pending `GS.RelativeFundamentalWeightStatement`: the actual simple real coroot basis, bases dual to the simple coroots and simple roots, and uniqueness of each fundamental weight and coweight in its specified relative subspace | A: candidate `89ad3e08-f0ca-4e7e-b9fb-5a257e4a4616`; not yet published or proved |
| V.3.13 `𝔞_G ⊂ 𝔞_L ⊂ 𝔞_M ⊂ 𝔞_∅`, with `𝔞_M` the annihilator of `Δ^M_∅` | `GS.StandardLeviCentralDirectionsStatement`: for every standard Levi, the split component embeds into `A_∅` with real cocharacter image the annihilator of the selected simple roots, with the ranks | P (`standardLeviCentralDirections`) |
| V.3.13 `𝔞^*_∅ = 𝔞^*_G ⊕ (𝔞^G_∅)^*`, with `(𝔞^G_∅)^*` the span of `Δ_∅` | the real part of `GS.RelativeCharacterRootComplementStatement` (the real root span and the restricted characters of `G` are complementary) | P |
| V.3.13 `𝔞^*_M` as the annihilator of the coroots of `M`; `𝔞_∅ = 𝔞_G ⊕ 𝔞^G_∅` with `𝔞^G_∅` the coroot span; `𝔞^*_M = 𝔞^*_L ⊕ (𝔞^L_M)^*` and its dual; orthogonality; projections `p^L_M` | pending `GS.StandardLeviRealDecompositionStatement`: for `J ⊆ K ⊆ Δ_∅`, root and coroot annihilator models, their perfect restricted pairing, the direct sums and projected spanning sets, and orthogonality for every invariant scalar product. The relative character space is the intersection of the coroot annihilator of `J` with the span of `K`, correcting I4; dually for cocharacters. The direct sums determine the projections | A: candidate `89ad3e08-f0ca-4e7e-b9fb-5a257e4a4616`. Proofs and the actual split-component character-space comparison remain separate; no named `p^L_M` map is added by this statement. The printed unprojected span remains false (I4) |
| V.3.14 `Δ(P)`, `Δ̂(P)`, `Δ^∨(P)`, `β̌` | [RestrictedSimpleRootCones](../../Langlands/GroupScheme/Rational/RestrictedSimpleRootCones.md) (`restrictedSimpleRoots`), `GS.ParabolicRootPresentation` | D. `Δ̂(P)`, `Δ^∨(P)` and `β̌` are not constructed |

| V.3.18 Langlands' combinatorial lemma | none | G, owned by Task 5474 (`9abd0e5e`, statement task, no executor yet). The Euclidean projection theorem of V.5.5 is stated and proved (`Langlands.Renard.ConeProjectionStatements`) |

A step of the source argument says "tout morphisme" but uses smoothness; without it the descent fails (`M = 𝔾_m` over `ℚ_p`), as the statement's [Markdown](../../Langlands/Representation/Plancherel/RationalSmoothRealDescentStatement.md) records |
| V.3.20 `𝔞^*_ℂ = Hom(Λ(M), ℂ) → X(M)` via `q^{-s}`: surjectivity, kernel `(2iπ/ln q)ℛ`, real part `ℜ(χ)` independent of the lift, unitary characters are those with `ℜ(χ) = 0` | `PL.RationalComplexParameterStatement` (on the actual valuation image `Λ(M)`), `RationalImageComplexExponential`, `RationalImageRealPart` | P: `rationalComplexParameter` |
| V.3.20 `𝔞^*_ℂ = Hom_ℤ(Λ(M), ℂ)` identified with `X^*(M) ⊗_ℤ ℂ` | `PL.RationalCharacterTensorParameterStatement`: the canonical map `ℂ ⊗_ℤ X^*(G) → Hom_ℤ(Λ(G), ℂ)`, `s ⊗ χ ↦ (a ↦ s a(χ))`, is bijective for every connected reductive `G` over a nonarchimedean local field, so for every Levi `M` (on the actual valuation image `Λ(G)`, with Mathlib's scalar-first tensor order) | P: `rationalCharacterTensorParameterBijective` |

| V.3.20 "on retrouve ainsi la structure de tore algébrique de `X(M)`"; `Im X(M)` is a real submanifold of the complex torus `X(M)` | Partial. The Library gives `X(M)` its coordinate algebra `ℂ[Λ(M)]` (V.2.4 above) and basis-dependent isomorphisms of topological groups `X(M) ≃ (ℂ^×)^r` and `Im X(M) ≃ (S¹)^r`, `r` the rank of `Λ(M)` (`PL.rationalCanonicalUnramifiedCharacterCoordinates`, `PL.rationalCanonicalUnitaryUnramifiedCharacterCoordinates`, definitions, in [RationalUnramifiedCharacterCoordinates](../../Langlands/Representation/Plancherel/RationalUnramifiedCharacterCoordinates.md)). It constructs no variety or manifold structure on `X(M)` itself, and no statement compares the exponential with the algebraic structure. The two published statement files of the previous rows list these assertions as separate obligations | D (coordinates); G (small) for the algebraic and submanifold assertions. See also remark R2 |
| V.3.21 `M^+`, `M^{++}` (inverse images under `H_M` of the chambers) and the full cones `A^+_M`, `A^{++}_M` (all `a ∈ A_M` with `|α(a)|_F ≤ 1`, resp. `< 1`, for `α ∈ Δ(P)`) | For the minimal Levi, `Langlands.BruhatTits.Cartan.dominantCentralizer` is `M_∅^+` on the actual centralizer points (see [RenardDominantValuation](../../Langlands/Representation/Plancherel/RenardDominantValuation.md)). The full `A`-cones appear only inline, as `CocharacterUniformizer.characterNorm` conditions on all points of `A(F)`, for example the hypotheses `characterNorm F S α x ≤ 1` for the simple roots in `StandardCasselmanUniformAsymptotics.lean`. There is no named definition of `M^+`, `M^{++}` for non-minimal `M` or of `A^+_M`, `A^{++}_M`. `CocharacterUniformizer.CAplus` and `CAstrict` are the lattice cuts `C_A^+ = C_A ∩ M^+` and `C_A^{++}` of V.3.23, not these full cones | D: minimal-Levi `M^+`; full cones inline only |

## Evidence for the focused V.3.6–V.3.13 update

Candidate `92aa130e-c278-47d0-8647-615541ba61c5` was independently approved by
Reviewer 1171 without qualifications and published at Library
`7f43c3c930ff92f76dae6589da1678ad729017e5`. Its exact Lean/Markdown pair agrees
with the current Library and this workspace. Recovery check
`152d5695-5c49-46e5-9551-acde4a9ba2ac` compiles the module and inspects
`Langlands.GroupScheme.RenardLeviCentralDecompositionStatement` as a
`Prop`-valued definition with universe parameter `u` and only standard axioms.
This is statement evidence. Task 6224 has no submitted proof as inspected on
13 November 2026.

Worker 4's candidate `89ad3e08-f0ca-4e7e-b9fb-5a257e4a4616` contains the
four component statements above and their conjunction
`Langlands.GroupScheme.RelativeRealCorootLinearAlgebraStatement` in module
`Langlands.GroupScheme.Rational.RelativeRealCorootStatements`. Its frozen
Lean and Markdown were read in full. Machine validation passed and Reviewer
1315 independently approved it without qualifications; TaskHub still reports
`accepted: false`, `public: false` while integration is pending. The **A** rows
mean semantic approval awaiting integration, and supply no published or proved
coverage. Worker 4 retains the proof-successor work after publication.

Its statements are over arbitrary fields, on the shared actual torus spaces,
and universally quantify over supplied integral reflection data. Existence of
those data is a separate published statement; no new existence proof is
claimed here. The standard-Levi spaces are ambient root/coroot annihilators.
Their identification with the character and cocharacter spaces of actual split
components needs the existing standard-Levi comparisons and any remaining

statement settles every geometric realization. The corrected projected-root
form of V.3.13 preserves source issue I4 below.

Renard writes that `A` is generated by the `a_z`, `z ∈ C_∅`; the statement uses the dominant generators `z ∈ C_∅^+`, which is what the second Lemma and all later uses concern (see the statement's [Markdown](../../Langlands/Representation/Hecke/IwahoriHeckeDecompositionStatement.md), "Formal choices") |
| V.5.3 finiteness Lemma for the generated subalgebra `M`: "L'algèbre `M` est un `A`-module de type fini" | none | G: not stated. The published statement states only the module form and keeps this assertion as an outstanding source obligation (its Markdown, "Not stated"): the generated subalgebra can be larger than the module span (`G_m` over `ℚ_3`, `K = 1 + 3ℤ_3`, `F_0 = {-1}`: the span is `Aε` and the algebra is `A ⊕ Aε`), and the source proof treats only products `a_{z₁} a_{z₂ f}` |

### Verified V.5.3 module-form proof

Worker 127's [proof and explanation](../../Langlands/Representation/Hecke/IwahoriHeckeDecompositionProof.md)
prove the unchanged seven-clause statement, including both left and right finite
generation of the specified module and both sandwich spanning formulas. Its
hypotheses retain the actual connected reductive group over a nonarchimedean
local field, available corrected building data, the special vertex, the compact
open subgroup normal in `K_0` with the supplied simultaneous standard-parabolic
basis properties, and an arbitrary finite lattice transversal. These structural
and topological premises are not discharged by the proof.

The finite-generation argument uses `IwahoriHeckeCore`: root-pairing floor
coordinates, finite tests for invariant subsets of a compact set, and Dickson's
lemma with finite labels. It uses neither the false free-monoid assertion of
V.3.24 nor a Gordan-lemma prerequisite. Commutation for the right-handed argument
is proved for the actual split-component images and centralizer representatives.
The source was rechecked at V.3.24 and V.5.3, printed pp.117, 123–125 / PDF
pp.123, 129–131. This alternate proof does not establish the generated-subalgebra
finiteness claim in the separate table row or correct the V.3.24 assertion.

Proof artifact `89acef8f-5eea-4013-8b16-98c6155a7ac4` is independently accepted
and public at commit `cc5aa77fa8dbdc6e723091c7b710ab0d81162c4e`.
Its `lean.proof@1` validation accepts the Lake build, exact target
`Langlands.Hecke.IwahoriHeckeDecompositionStatement`, unchanged statement and
frozen inputs. Reviewer 313 approved it without qualifications. At the Library
commit used for this update, the proof pair and both helper pairs
(`IwahoriHeckeCore`, `MassIndicatorProducts`) match their frozen accepted bytes.
This evidence supplies proof coverage for that exact conditional statement,
not whole-section or whole-book completion.

## Remarks and source issues

- **R1. V.4.8, `w · P = P̄′` (printed p.122 / PDF p.128).** The rendered page has the
  overline; text extraction loses it. Without it the assertion fails: in `GL_2` with `M` the
  diagonal torus and `w = s`, `s · B` is the lower triangular Borel subgroup. The candidate
  `4d34998c` states the version with the overline.
- **R2. V.3.20, the real part (printed p.116 / PDF p.122).** Renard first defines `ℜ(χ)` by
  lifting through the `q^{-s}` exponential, then writes `ℜ(χ) = ln |χ|`. Under the fixed
  positive valuation the two differ by the negative factor `−ln q`. The Library uses the
  first (normalized) convention throughout and records the discrepancy in
  [ArbitraryParabolicTempered](../../Langlands/Representation/Exponents/ArbitraryParabolicTempered.md)
  ("Parameter convention and retained source discrepancy") and in
  [LanglandsTriplet](../../Langlands/Representation/LanglandsClassification/LanglandsTriplet.md).
- **I1. (V.3.21.1) (printed p.116 / PDF p.122).** The book writes `A^+_M = ⊔_Q A^{++}_L` over
  the standard `Q = LU ⊇ P`, with `A^{++}_L ⊂ A_L`. As an equality of subsets of `A_M` it
  fails. In `GL_2` with `P = B`, `M` the diagonal torus and `u ∈ 𝔒_F^×`, `u ≠ 1`, the
  element `diag(1, u)` satisfies `|α(diag(1, u))|_F = 1`. It therefore lies in `A^+_M` but
  not in `A^{++}_M`, and it is not central, so it is not in `A_G`. The decomposition holds on
  the valuation side, for the chambers in `𝔞_M` (V.3.16), and for the lattice parts `C_A`.
  It also holds modulo `⁰A_M`. V.3.24 uses it in the lattice form
  `S = ⊔ C^{++}_{A_L}/C_{A_G}`.
- **I2. V.3.24 (printed p.117 / PDF p.123).** The claim `S = C^+_∅/C_{A_G} ≅ ℕ^d` with
  `d = |Δ_∅|` is false in general. The published
  [IwahoriHeckeDecompositionStatement](../../Langlands/Representation/Hecke/IwahoriHeckeDecompositionStatement.md)
  records this source issue (Reviewer 1385): for the diagonal torus of `SL_3`, `C^+_∅` in
  simple-root coordinates is `{(p, q) ∈ ℕ² | p ≡ q mod 3}`, and `(3,0) + (0,3) = 3·(1,1)`.

- **I3. V.5.5 (printed pp.127–128 / PDF pp.133–134).** Two points, recorded in the Markdown of
  the published
  [RenardConeProjectionStatements](../../Langlands/Analysis/RenardConeProjectionStatements.md).
  First, the Proposition's characterization (iii) needs `C ≠ E`: for `C = E` the strict dual
  cone `Č = {u | ∀ w ∈ C, 0 < ⟨u, w⟩}` is empty (take `w = 0`), so (iii) fails although
  `p_C(v) = v`. The Lean statement also makes explicit that `C` is nonempty and convex.
  Second, the display `Č = {∑ sᵢ αᵢ, sᵢ > 0}` before the Corollary is false as an equality
  of sets. The exact set is `{∑ sᵢ αᵢ | sᵢ ≥ 0, not all zero}`. For the standard basis of
  `ℝ²` and `C = (0, ∞)²`, the vector `(1, 0)` pairs strictly positively with every point of
  `C` but has a zero second coefficient. In positive dimension both sets have the same
  closure `{∑ sᵢ αᵢ | sᵢ ≥ 0}`, which is all the proof uses. In dimension zero `Č` and its
  closure are empty, and the Corollary holds directly. The display is not stated; the
  proved Corollary does not depend on it.

- **I4. V.3.13 (printed pp.112–113 / PDF pp.118–119).** The book defines `(𝔞^L_M)^*` as the
  subspace of `𝔞^*_∅` spanned by the `α ∈ Δ^L_∅ ∖ Δ^M_∅` and writes `𝔞^*_M = 𝔞^*_L ⊕ (𝔞^L_M)^*`,
  in particular `𝔞^*_M = 𝔞^*_G ⊕ (𝔞^G_M)^*`. With `𝔞^*_M ⊂ 𝔞^*_∅` the annihilator of the coroots
  of `M`, this fails: for `G = L = GL_3` and `M = GL_2 × GL_1` standard, `𝔞^*_M = {(x, x, y)}`,
  while `α_2 = (0, 1, −1)` pairs with `α̌_1 = (1, −1, 0)` to `−1`, so `α_2 ∉ 𝔞^*_M`. The
  decomposition holds with the roots projected to `𝔞^*_M` (equivalently restricted to `𝔞_M`), as in
  the definition of `Δ(P)` in V.3.14. Reviewer 2262 found this point.

## Genuine gaps of Chapter V

1. V.3.16 cone decompositions and V.3.18 Langlands' combinatorial lemma, with the
   constructions they need (fundamental weights and coweights, `Δ̂(P)`, `β̌`, the
   `W`-invariant inner product and the projections `p^L_M`). Task 5474 owns V.3.18.
2. V.3.6–V.3.13 linear algebra and its realization: the compatible-diagram
   decompositions for arbitrary Levis are now stated, with exact proof Task 6224
   (`423ad442-9268-4104-a37f-3f1d8eb63388`) open. The four real-coroot, real-basis,
   fundamental-weight and corrected standard-Levi statements in candidate
   `89ad3e08-f0ca-4e7e-b9fb-5a257e4a4616` await integration and proofs. The geometric
   compatible-component realization and actual split-component/ambient-annihilator
   comparisons remain distinct obligations; their necessary published inputs do
   not alone establish every source-Levi instance.
3. V.5.1 Corollary: `K_0`-conjugacy of every parabolic to a standard one (now stated by the
   candidate `3e44f4be`, under review).
4. V.5.3, the finiteness Lemma for the generated subalgebra `M`. It is retained as an
   outstanding source obligation by the published `IwahoriHeckeDecompositionStatement`,
   which states the module form. The source proof covers only the module form.
5. V.3.20: the algebraic-torus structure of `X(M)` recovered through the exponential, and
   `Im X(M)` as a real submanifold of `X(M)`. The tensor identification, the pure-tensor
   formula and the compact imaginary quotient are proved (rows above).
6. Recalled assertions not stated in the Library: `P(M)` finite (V.3.1), the
   closed-subset intersection Proposition ([7] 3.22) of V.4.2, the equalities
   `N_G(A_M) = N_G(M)` and `Z_G(A_M) = M` for non-minimal `M` (V.3.5; the minimal case and the
   centralizer of the full central torus are proved, see the V.3.5 row), and the maximal anisotropic subtorus with
   the almost-direct-product decomposition (V.2.2 Remark 2).

## Proof tasks of Worker 1222's Chapter V statements

`51acec26` (V.2.3, V.2.5, V.2.6: unimodularity of `⁰G`, `⁰A₁ = A₁ ∩ ⁰A₂`, compact centre) is
published; its proof task is Task 5711. `4d34998c` (V.4.3.3 and V.4.8) is published; its proof
task is Task 5688. Task 5679 is the proof task for the published `SplitComponentKernelStatement`
(V.2.6 Lemma) and `FullLatticeRepresentativeStatement` (V.3.23), which had none.

The compatible-component V.3.6 statement
`92aa130e-c278-47d0-8647-615541ba61c5` is published and has exact proof Task 6224
(`423ad442-9268-4104-a37f-3f1d8eb63388`). Its arbitrary-field scope, literal
restriction kernel and actual pairing annihilator are retained. The pending
real-coroot unit has no published proof successor yet; Worker 4 will supply
those tasks after its integration.
